        History of NSWBN
      </h2>
      <p>
        The National Seafarers Welfare Board of Nigeria (NSWBN) was established
        in 2003 with a resolute commitment to advancing the welfare of seafarers
        operating within Nigerian waters and globally. In recognition of its
        pivotal role, the NSWBN was formally registered as incorporated trustees
        with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) on March 30th, 2007. This
        milestone marked the beginning of a dedicated journey towards ensuring
        that the welfare needs of seafarers are met in accordance with
        international standards. The Board’s establishment is deeply rooted in
        the principles enshrined in the International Labour Organization’s
        (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC, 2006), particularly the
        provisions of Regulation 4.4, Standard A4, as amended. Nigeria’s
        ratification of the MLC, 2006 on June 18th, 2013, and its subsequent
        implementation by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency
        (NIMASA) underscores the national commitment to this cause.
